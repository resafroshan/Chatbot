# Steps involved in creating chatbot

Step 1: Creating an agent, I have created an agent named Valorant_Hospital, which is used to communicate with the end users

Step 2: Defining Entities Entities can be fields, data, or text describing just about anything â€” a time, place, person, item, number, etc. Using natural language processing (NLP), chatbots can extract entities from entries that users type in order to turn around accurate recommendations and answers.

Step 3: Intents Intent refers to the goal that customer has in mind when typing in a question or comment. While entity refers to the modifier the customer uses to describe their issue, intent is what they really mean. Here are my intents

Step 4: Training phrases Training phrases are example phrases for what end-users might type or say, referred to as end-user expressions. For each intent, you create many training phrases. When an end-user expression resembles one of these phrases, Dialogflow matches the intent.

Step 5: Actions and parameters Dialogflow sends an API interaction response for each step of slot filling. For each of these slot filling responses, the intent and action will be the same, and the parameters collected so far will be provided. When building an agent, we provide prompts that the agent will use to get parameter data from the end-user.

Step 6: Responses The responses available are Text, Option, Pause and Image. I used only the text response type which is used for ordinary text responses.
